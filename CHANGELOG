* Don't use encoding options with nil values
* Added encoding options video_max_bitrate, video_min_bitrate and buffer_size for constant bitrate encoding

== 0.6.7 2010-06-10

* Bugfix - aspect ratio preserver could suggest non even resolutions in certain circumstances 

== 0.6.6 2010-06-10

* Transcodings to .jpg and .png will now work as they will skip duration validation

== 0.6.5 2010-05-19

* Skipping the transcoders duration validation if original file has uncertain duration

* Changed Movie#valid? logic to accept any movie with either a readable audio or video stream

== 0.6.0 2010-05-04

* Cropping options now handled by EncodingOptions (croptop, cropbottom, cropleft and cropright)
